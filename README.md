XS: The eXtensible Shell
========================

**NOTICE: As of February 2021 I will no longer maintain the XS project. If you care to assume ownership of this repo, please open an issue.**

This is `xs 1.3`; see `doc/CHANGES`.

XS is the eXtensible Shell, a command line interpreter featuring
Lisp-like semantics (lists, function parameters, closures, exceptions,
lexical bindings, lambdas, etc.) and a conventional syntax.

The package includes extensive documentation. Sample scripts to define
library functions, tools and utilities are found in
[https://github.com/TieDyedDevil/XS-library.git](https://github.com/TieDyedDevil/XS-library.git)  .

Use meson-0.54.x or meson-0.56.x to build XS.
